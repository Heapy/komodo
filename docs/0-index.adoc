= Komodo Documentation

> This documentation describes default Komodo setup. You can customize every part of komodo, even rewrite all implementations of standard services and replace interfaces and DI. But more practical and easy - use default services.

== Hello, World!

[source,kotlin]
----
komodo {
    module(TestModule1::class)
}
----

== Configuration

Configuration stored in Kotlin Script `.kts` files. Every configuration return either one configuration object, of list of objects.
You can pass list of configuration files to Komodo and objects of one type will be overwrited by rule - last write wins. So if you pass two files with instances of one class - object in second passed file will win.
